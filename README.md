# Humanities Texts

This project engages students as collaborators on open editions of humanities texts. It is designed to encourage rigorous (also, authentic and enjoyable) reading and research experiences for students. The editions you see listed below will grow to incorporate the work of the students who read and investigate them. Under semester headings, you can see editors' notes describing how and why they have contributed to the editions on this site.
